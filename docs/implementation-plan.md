**Week 3**:
- Continue Phase 4: Complete all components and content

**Week 4**:

## Why This Order Makes Sense

1. **Research First**: Can't design effectively without understanding the competition and requirements
2. **Design System Second**: Establishes consistent visual language before building
3. **Infrastructure Third**: Updates foundational code that everything else depends on
4. **Implementation Fourth**: Build features with proper foundation in place
5. **Polish Last**: Fine-tune after everything is functional

## Key Principles

- **Don't skip research** - It informs all decisions
- **Design system before components** - Ensures consistency
- **Infrastructure before features** - Prevents rework
- **Function before polish** - Get it working, then make it beautiful
- **Test throughout** - Not just at the end

## Success Criteria

- Matches client's gold/white modern minimal aesthetic
- Clearly focused on e-commerce fulfillment
- Competitive with reference sites
- Professional and trustworthy appearance
- Ready by October 10, 2025 launch date
